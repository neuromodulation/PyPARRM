    """Compute power spectral density of data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ~numpy.ndarray, shape of [channels, times]
        Data for which power should be computed (assumed to be real-valued).

    sampling_freq : int
        Sampling frequency, in Hz, of `data`.

    n_points : int
        Number of points to use when computing the Fourier coefficients. Should
        be double the desired number of frequencies in the power spectra.

    max_freq : int | float | None (default None)
        The maximum frequency that should be returned. If :obj:`None`, values
        for all computed frequencies returned.

    n_jobs : int (default ``1``)
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : ~numpy.ndarray, shape of [frequencies]
        Frequencies in `psd`.

    psd : ~numpy.ndarray, shape of [channels, frequencies]
        Power spectral density of `data`.

    Notes
    -----
    No checks on the inputs are performed for speed.

    Data is converted to, and power is returned as, float32 values for speed.

    As `data` is assumed to be real-valued, only positive frequencies are
    returned. The zero frequency is also discarded.
