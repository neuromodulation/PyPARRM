# PyPARRM

A Python signal processing package for identifying and removing stimulation
artefacts from electrophysiological data using the Period-based Artefact
Reconstruction and Removal Method (PARRM) of Dastin-van Rijn *et al.* (2021;
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100010).

This package is based on the original MATLAB implementation of the method
(https://github.com/neuromotion/PARRM). All credit for the method goes to its
original authors.

Parallel processing is supported to reduce computation times.
