# Background
# ----------
# When delivering electrical stimulation to bioligical tissues for research or
# clinical purposes, it is often the case that electrophysiological recordings
# collected during this time are contaminated by stimulation artefacts. This
# contamination makes it difficult to analyse the underlying physiological or
# pathophysiological electrical activity. To this end, the Period-based
# Artefact Reconstruction and Removal Method (PARRM) was developed, enabling
# the removal of stimulation arefacts from electrophysiological recordings in a
# robust and computationally cheap manner :footcite:`DastinEtAl2021`. **N.B.**
# PARRM assumes that the artefacts are semi-regular, periodic, and linearly
# combined with the signal of interest.
#
# To demonstrate how PARRM can be used to remove stimulation arfectacts from
# data, we will start by loading some example data. This is the same example
# data used in the MATLAB implementation of the method
# (https://github.com/neuromotion/PARRM), consisting of a single channel
# with ~100 seconds of data at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz, and containing
# stimulation artefacts with a frequency of 150 Hz.

# %%

data = np.load(get_example_data_paths("example_data"))
sampling_freq = 200  # Hz
artefact_freq = 150  # Hz

print(
    f"`data` has shape: ({data.shape[0]} channel, "
    f"{data.shape[1]} timepoints)\n"
    f"`data` duration: {data.shape[1] / sampling_freq :.2f} seconds"
)

# Finding the period of the stimulation artefacts
# -----------------------------------------------
# Having loaded the example data, we can now find the period of the stimulation
# artefacts, which we require to remove them from the data. Having imported the
# PARRM object, we initialise it, providing the data, its sampling frequency,
# and the stimulation frequency.
#
# After this, we find the period of the artefact using the :meth:`find_period
# <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.find_period>` method. By default, all timepoints of the
# data will be used for this, and the initial guess of the period will be taken
# as the sampling frequency divided by the artefact frequency. The settings for
# finding the period can be specified in the method call, however the default
# settings should suffice as a starting point for period estimation.
#
# The period is found using a grid search, with the goal of minimising the mean
# squared error between the data and the best fitting sinusoidal harmonics of
# the period found with linear regression. The process is described in detail
# in Dastin *et al.* (2021) :footcite:`DastinEtAl2021`, and is also
# demonstrated in this `video
# <https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2667237521000102-mmc2.mp4>`_
# from the paper's authors.

# Creating the filter and removing the artefacts
# ----------------------------------------------
# Now that we have an estimate of the artefact period, we can design a filter
# to remove it from the data using the :meth:`create_filter
# <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.create_filter>` method. When creating the filter, there
# are four key parameters:
#
# 1. The size of the filter window, specified with the ``filter_half_width``
#    parameter. This should be chosen based on the timescale on which the
#    artefact shape varies. If no such timescale is known, the power spectra of
#    the filtered data can be inspected and the size of the filter window tuned
#    until artefact-related peaks are sufficiently attenuated.
#
# 2. The number of samples to omit from the centre of the filter window,
#    specified with the ``omit_n_samples`` parameter. This parameter serves to
#    control for overfitting to features of interest in the underlying data.
#    For instance, if there is a physiological signal of interest known to
#    occur on a particular timescale, an appropriate number of samples should
#    be omitted according to this range of time.
#
# 3. The direction considered when building the filter, specified with the
#    ``filter_direction`` parameter. This can be used to control whether the
#    filter window takes only previous samples, future samples, or both
#    previous and future samples into account, based on their position relative
#    to the centre of the filter window.
#
# 4. The period window size, specified with the ``period_half_width``
#    parameter. The size of this window should be based on changes in the
#    waveform of the artefact, which can be estimated by plotting the data on
#    the timescale of the period and identifying the timescale over which
#    features remain fairly constant. This parameter controls which samples are
#    combined on the timescale of the period.
#
# If you are unsure of what parameters are best for your data, you can use the
# interactive parameter exploration tool offered in PyPARRM (see the
# :meth:`explore_filter_params <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.explore_filter_params>`
# method and the associated example: :doc:`plot_use_param_explorer`).
#
# Here, we specify that the filter should have a half-width of 2,000 samples,
# ignoring those 20 samples adjacent to the centre of the filter window,
# considering samples both before and after the centre of the filter window,
# and finally using a half-width of 0.01 samples in the period space.
#
# Once the filter has been created, it can be applied using the
# :meth:`filter_data <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.filter_data>` method, which returns
# the artefact-free data. By default,
# :meth:`filter_data <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.filter_data>` will filter the data
# stored in the :class:`PARRM <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM>` object, however other data
# can be provided should you wish to filter this instead. The filter itself, as
# well as a copy of the filtered data, can be accessed from the :attr:`filter
# <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.filter>` and :attr:`filtered_data
# <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.filtered_data>` attributes, respectively.

# Inspecting the results
# ----------------------
# Having filtered the data, we can now compare the results to the original
# data, as well as the artefact-free form of this simulated data to see how
# well the method is able to remove the underlying artefacts.
#
# As you can see, the filtered timeseries data closely resembles the true
# artefact-free data. Furthermore, inspecting the power spectra shows just how
# well PARRM is able to attentuate the overwhelming power at the 50 Hz
# subharmonic of the stimulation artefacts, again bringing the results closely
# in line with those of the true artefact-free data.

# Python vs. MATLAB implementation comparison
# -------------------------------------------
# Due to rounding errors, the final filtered data timeseries of PyPARRM and the
# MATLAB implementation are not perfectly identical (as shown by the failure of
# :func:`numpy.all`), however they are extremely close (as shown by the success
# of :func:`numpy.allclose`). Visual inspection of the plots further
# demonstrates this similarity. Accordingly, both implementations are suitable
# for identifying and removing stimulation artefacts from electrophysiological
# recordings.
