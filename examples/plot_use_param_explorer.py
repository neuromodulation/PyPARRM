# Background
# ----------
# Once you have an estimate of the artefact period, you need to design a filter
# to remove the artefacts from your data. There are four key filter parameters:
#
# 1. The size of the filter window. This should be chosen based on the
#    timescale of which the artefact shape varies.
#
# 2. The number of samples to omit from the centre of the filter window. This
#    parameter serves to control for overfitting to features of interest in the
#    underlying data.
#
# 3. The direction considered when building the filter. This can be used to
#    control whether the filter window takes only previous samples, future
#    samples, or both previous and future samples into account, based on their
#    position relative to the centre of the filter window.
#
# 4. The period window size. The size of this window should be based on changes
#    in the waveform of the artefact. This parameter controls which samples are
#    combined on the timescale of the period.
#
# These parameters are described in detail in Dastin *et al.* (2021)
# :footcite:`DastinEtAl2021` and the supplementary `video
# <https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2667237521000102-mmc2.mp4>`_
# from the paper's authors. Crucially, visualising the effects of these
# parameters can help greatly for identifying the best settings to use when
# creating a filter for your data.

# Exploring the filter parameters
# -------------------------------
# Once you have an an estimate of the artefact period (see the following
# example for a detailed explanation of how to do this: :doc:`plot_use_parrm`),
# you can now visualise the effects of the filter parameters to find those that
# best remove the stimulation artefacts from the data. To do this, we call the
# :meth:`explore_filter_params <pyparrm.parrm.PARRM.explore_filter_params>`
# method.
#
# The explorer consists of four plots, and a set of controls:
#
# * The textboxes and buttons in the bottom left of the explorer allow you to
#   manipulate the filter settings. The default settings of the explorer
#   reflect the settings that would be used when computing the filter if you
#   did not specify any inputs. You can change: the period half-width
#   (``period_half_width``); the filter half-width (``filter_half_width``);
#   the number of omitted samples (``omit_n_samples``); and the filter
#   direction (``filter_direction``). The ranges of possible values that can be
#   entered in the textboxes are shown in brackets.
#
# * The top left plot shows the data samples in the period space according to
#   the current period half-width. Just below this is an overview plot of all
#   the samples in the period space. The red area shows the region currently
#   being viewed in the top left plot. The period space can be moved through
#   using the left and right arrow keys. With these plots, you can find a
#   suitable period half-width, such that the waveform of the artefact remains
#   fairly constant (i.e. a straight line could easily be drawn through the
#   plotted samples in period space). Furthermore, as you change the filter
#   half-width, these plots will reflect the change in the number of available
#   samples.
#
# * Most importantly, the two plots on the right-hand side show the unfiltered
#   and filtered data according to the current filter settings in the time
#   domain (top plot) and in the frequency domain (bottom plot). Both plots are
#   updated in real-time according to changes in the filter settings. The
#   power spectral density is particularly useful for identifying which filters
#   reduce the signal's power at the artefact frequency (as well as at the
#   harmonics and sub-harmonics). In some cases, the filter settings may not
#   produce a valid filter, in which case a warning on the time domain plot
#   will be printed.
#
# If computational cost is a concern, a limited time range of the data and its
# resolution can be specified, as well as the frequency range and resolution of
# the power spectral density. If multiple channels are present in your data,
# these can be navigated between using the up and down arrow keys. Finally, the
# title of the explorer gives you an overview of the current filter settings,
# as well as which channel's data is currently being viewed.
#
# The method can be called as ``parrm.explore_filter_params()``. The image
# below shows the different aspects of the parameter explorer window.
